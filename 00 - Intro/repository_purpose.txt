    Hey there, thanks for sparing time and reading the introduction! I am Arca. My purpose for creating this
repository is to explain the usage of Python in the simplest way. Having clear, brief and 'to the point' descriptions.
Hence I have been making a research of the various python courses online; there are dozens of brilliant tutors
who publish their courses for free on the internet, but personally I found out that Corey Schafer's python course
was the best suited for my understanding, of course no disrespect to the other creators.

    For that reason I have decided to compile all the code that has been used in that course and edited parts of it with
my custom data. Mr. Schafer does a fantastic job explaining each command or functionality. My goal was to enhance those 
descriptions by tweaking them and adding in some of my own explanations. I believe simplicity is essential for new
learners to comprehend python. Hope my efforts help society; as more and more people are becoming interested in learning
automation to use in their work or their daily life.

    Kudos to Mr. Corey Schafer since he was the original creator of the format. Special thanks to my tutor Mr. Tayfun Elmas
who spared so much of his time to help me learn programming.
