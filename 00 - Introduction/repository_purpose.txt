    Hey there, thanks for sparing time and reading the introduction! I am Arca. My purpose for creating this repository is to explain the usage of Python in the most simple manner . Having clear, brief and 'to the point' descriptions. Hence I have been researching the various Python courses online; dozens of brilliant tutors publish their courses for free on the internet, but I found out that Corey Schafer's Python course was the best suited for my understanding. Of course, no disrespect to the other creators.

    For that reason, I have decided to compile all the code that has been used in the aforementioned course and edited parts of it with my custom data. Mr. Schafer does a fantastic job explaining each command or functionality. My goal was to enhance those descriptions by tweaking them and adding in some of my own explanations. I believe simplicity is essential for new learners
to comprehend Python. Hope my efforts will be helpful for society; as more and more people are becoming interested in learning programming and using automation within their work or in their daily life. Kudos to Mr. Corey Schafer since he was the original creator of the content. And a special thanks to my tutor Mr. Tayfun Elmas who spared his time to teach me programming.

    Scripts within the repository have been written in Visual Studio Code and built with Python v3-11. Both of the applications are free to use and can be downloaded from their website. Before getting into programming, users need to set up a Python development environment within their operating system. There are plenty of free guides about the installation process hence I won't be delving into that matter, at least for now... And finally, the text editor choice is preferential among the users. There are several good options available.
