    Hey there, thanks for sparing time and reading the introduction! I am Arca. My purpose for creating this repository is to explain the usage of Python in the simplest way, having clear and to the point descriptions. Hence i have been making a research of the various python courses online, there are dozens of
brilliant tutors who publish their courses for free on the internet. But personally i found out that Corey Schafer's python course was the best suited for my understanding, of course no disrespect to other creators.

    That's why I have decided to put up all the code that has been used by Mr. Schafer within that course. He does a fantastic job explaining each functionality or command he uses. My goal was to enhance those descriptions by tweaking them and adding in some of my own explanations here and there. I believe simplicity is
essential for new learners to comprehend python. Hope this will help society as more and more people are interested in learning automation to use in their daily life, or their work.

    Special thanks to my tutor Mr. Tayfun Elmas who spared so much of his time and teached me programming. And kudos to Mr. Corey Schafer since he was the original creator of these contents.
