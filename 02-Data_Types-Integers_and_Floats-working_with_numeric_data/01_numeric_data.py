# Arithmetic Operators:
# Addition              +
# Subtraction           -
# Multiplication        *
# Division              /
# Floor Division        //
# Exponent              **
# Modulus               %

# While I'm sure everybody reading the script is pretty familiar with first four operators;
# If users wish to drop the decimal on division operation, using floor division will suffice.
