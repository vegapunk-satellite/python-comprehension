# Just like in real life math class arithmetic, we can also use parentheses in our code to change the order of operations.
print(3 * 2 + 1)  # returns '7'
print(3 * (2 + 1))  # returns '9'

# Incrementing a variable:
num = 1
num_2 = 29

# num = num + 1
num += 1  # Simpler alternative of the code above, can be applied with other operations as well.
num_2 *= 3

print(num)
print(num_2)
